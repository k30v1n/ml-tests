DECISION TREE
- [1.DT-hello-world.py](1.DT-hello-world.py) is an example to introduce classifier. Classifiers is just a box of rules where you can run algorithms. In this example the Decision Tree is used to solve some Iris problems.
- [2.DT-iris-visualization.py](2.DT-iris-visualization.py) is an example to print the decision tree into a file so you can check what path the classifier used to make the decision of a given data.

FEATURES
- Good features are essencials to have a good ML program. But what is a good feature?
    - avoid duplication features
    - if a feature tells you nothing, don`t put it. Ex: height in inchs and centimeters, or a caracteristic that is not directly related with what your are analysing
    - the features should be usefull to improve the prediction engine
    - to determine the features try to THINK about what makes sense and what doesn`t
