Notes
- Good features are essencials to have a good ML program. But what is a good feature?
    - avoid duplication features
    - if a feature tells you nothing, don`t put it. Ex: height in inchs and centimeters, or a caracteristic that is not directly related with what your are analysing
    - the features should be usefull to improve the prediction engine
    - to determine the features try to THINK about what makes sense and what doesn`t
